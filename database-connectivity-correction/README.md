üìò Installation & Requirements

Welcome! Before starting the COBOL + PostgreSQL projects, you need to set up your environment.
Follow these steps carefully ‚Äî once complete, you‚Äôll be ready to compile COBOL programs, connect to PostgreSQL, and run the tasks.

1. Install Required Tools 

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gnucobol gcc libpq-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib make

2. Configure PostgreSQL
we‚Äôll use a shared default password so that every student work with the same setup.

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:

In real-world projects, you would never hardcode or reuse passwords like this.
Proper security practice is to create unique DB users per application, use strong passwords, and never commit them to a repo.
Here, we deliberately use postgres/postgres because this is a local, isolated learning environment and consistency is more important than security.

Set the password for the postgres user: 
<pre>
sudo -H -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';"
</pre>
once you‚Äôve successfully set the password, test the login:
<pre>
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT 1;"
</pre>
you should see : 
 ?column? 
----------
        1
(1 row)
Create the course database:

PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE schooldb;"

Verify your connection:
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -d schooldb -c "SELECT 1;"
If you see 1, the connection works.

PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE schooldb;" || true

Seed the Database
<pre>
DB_PASSWORD=postgres ./reset_db.sh
</pre>
This loads the schema and sample data from bootstrap.sql.
Check that tables exist:
<pre>
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -d schooldb -c "\dt"

</pre>

3. Build the wrapper (if you intend to ship the .c as part of the skeleton)
<pre>
gcc -shared -fPIC -o lib/libpgcob.so db_wrapper.c -I/usr/include/postgresql -lpq
ls -l lib/libpgcob.so
</pre>
lib/libpgcob.so
